# 📚 Project Overview

Welcome to the documentation for the **Full-Stack To-Do Manager**!

## Project Goal
The core goal of this project is to build a robust, production-ready application that enables users to manage their daily tasks. The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) will focus on CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for a single user task list.

## Key User Stories
* As a user, I want to add a new task so I can keep track of what I need to do.
* As a user, I want to view a list of all my tasks so I can see my priorities.
* As a user, I want to mark a task as complete so I know what is finished.
